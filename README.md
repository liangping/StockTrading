# Stock Trading

Experiments on Stock Price Forecasting using LSTMs and Stock Trading using Reinforcement Learning. Work done for the 6th semester Mini Project with [@pbcpraveen](https://github.com/pbcpraveen) and [@RamKaushikR](https://github.com/RamKaushikR).

## Dataset
We used the stock market data for Apple (`aapl.us.txt`) from the [Huge Stock Market Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/borismarjanovic/price-volume-data-for-all-us-stocks-etfs?), which is available on Kaggle.

## Experiments

1. Stock Price Forecasting using LSTMs ([ForecastingLSTM.ipynb](ForecastingLSTM.ipynb))

2. Stock Trading using Deep Q Learning ([TradingDeepQNetwork.ipynb](TradingDeepQNetwork.ipynb))

3. Stock Trading using Actor-Critic Method ([TradingActorCritic.ipynb](TradingActorCritic.ipynb))
